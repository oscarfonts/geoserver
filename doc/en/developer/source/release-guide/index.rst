Release Guide
=============

This guide details the process of performing a GeoServer release.

Notify developer lists
----------------------

It is good practice to notify the `GeoServer developer list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geoserver-devel>`_ of the intention to make the release a few days in advance, even though the release date has been agreed upon before hand. GeoServer releases are usually made in conjunction with GeoTools releases, so the GeoTools developer list should also be notified of the associated GeoTools release a few days in advance.

On the day the release is being made is it also good practice to send a warning
to the list asking that developers refrain from committing until the release tag
has been created.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are necessary to perform a GeoServer release:

#. Commit access to `GeoServer svn <https://svn.codehaus.org/geoserver>`_
#. Edit access to the `GeoServer wiki <http://geoserver.org>`_
#. Administration rights to the `GeoServer bug tracker (JIRA) <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS>`_
#. Write access to `GeoServer Maven Repository <http://repo.opengeo.org/>`_

For steps 2 through 4 above you may also ask someone on the developer list to perform the associated steps.

If a parallel GeoTools release is being preformed, see the `GeoTools Release Guide <http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOT/How+to+cut+a+release>`_. Alternatively you can (nicely) ask one of the GeoTools developers to perform the release for you.

Update source code
------------------

#. Update or check out the branch to be released from.
#. Ensure that :command:`svn status` yields no local modifications.

Update the README
-----------------

#. Add an entry to :file:`release/README.txt` using the following template::

     GeoServer [VERSION] ( [DATE] )
     ==============================

    This release is based on GeoTools 2.5.2.
    
   .. note::

     The "fixforversion" number for the JIRA changelog can be found by exploring the `GeoServer JIRA <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS>`_ before or after building the changelog.  See the links to the various unreleased versions.

#. Commit changes to the README::

     svn commit -m "Updating README for [VERSION]" release/README.txt

Create a release tag
--------------------

#. Create a tag for the release::

     svn copy -m "Create tag for release [VERSION]" https://svn.codehaus.org/geoserver/[BRANCH] https://svn.codehaus.org/geoserver/tags/[VERSION]

#. Checkout the release tag::

     svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/geoserver/tags/[VERSION] 

   .. warning:: 
      
      :command:`svn switch` may also be used to switch to the release tag but caution must be taken to switch back to the branch after the release has been performed.

Update version numbers in tag
-----------------------------

#. Upgrade the version number in the following files::

     src/release/installer/win/GeoServerEXE.nsi
     src/release/installer/win/wrapper.conf
     src/release/installer/mac/GeoServer.app/Contents/Info.plist
     src/release/bin.xml
     src/release/doc.xml
     src/release/src.xml
     src/web/src/main/java/ApplicationResources*
     doc/en/user/source/conf.py
     doc/en/developer/source/conf.py
     

   Example (using sed)::

     sed -i 's/1.7.1/1.7.2/g' src/release/installer/win/GeoServerEXE.nsi

#. Commit changes::

     svn commit -m "Updated version numbers for [VERSION]" release web/src/main/java
  
Upgrade branch pom versions
---------------------------

#. Update branch (*not in the newly-created tag!*) pom version numbers to include the next version with a "-SNAPSHOT" suffix::

     find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -i 's/[VERSION]-SNAPSHOT/[NEWVERSION]-SNAPSHOT/g' {} \;

   Example::

      find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -i 's/1.7.1-SNAPSHOT/1.7.2-SNAPSHOT/g' {} \; 

#. Commit changes::

      svn commit -m "Upgrading pom version to [NEWVERSION]-SNAPSHOT" .

Set tag pom versions
--------------------

#. Set tag pom version numbers to the correct version number (and removing the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix)::

     find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -i 's/[VERSION]-SNAPSHOT/[VERSION]/g' {} \;

   Example::

     find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -i 's/1.7.1-SNAPSHOT/1.7.1/g' {} \;

#. Commit changes::

     svn commit -m "Setting pom versions to [VERSION]" .

Build release artifacts
-----------------------

.. warning:: All operations for the remainder of this guide must be performed from the release tag, not the branch.

#. Compile from the root of the source tree with the following command::

     mvn clean install -P release

#. Build javadocs::

     mvn javadoc:aggregate

#. Build artifacts::

     mvn assembly:attached

At this point the release artifacts will be located in ``target/release``.

.. note::

     Due to an `issue <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS-2875>`_ with the 
     version of the maven assembly plugin currently used, the source artifact
     contains :file:`target` directories containing compiled classes and jars
     for each module, which increases its size significantly. The source 
     artifact should be unpacked, the directories removed, and re-archived::

       unzip geoserver-1.7.1-src.zip
       rm geoserver-1.7.1-src.zip
       cd geoserver-1.7.1
       find . -name target -exec rm -rf {} \;
       cd ..
       zip -r geoserver-1.7.1-src.zip geoserver-1.7.1

Build documentation
-------------------

.. note::

   Building the GeoServer documentation requires the following be installed:

     * `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, version 0.6 or greater

   It is also helpful to have :command:`make` installed, although it is not required.  For Windows users a :file:`make.bat` files exists that performs the same function.

HTML
````

#. Change to the root of the documentation directory, or check it out (if you don't already have it) from
   https://svn.codehaus.org/geoserver/tags/[VERSION]/doc

#. Change directory to :file:`doc/user`.

#. Build HTML files for the User Manual.

   * Option 1: Run the :command:`make` command::
  
       make html
   
   * Option 2: Run the :command:`sphinx-build` command::

       sphinx-build -b html . build/html

     .. note:: You may need to create the :file:`build/html` directory.

#. Go back to the root of the documentation tree, and change directory to :file:`doc/developer`.

#. Build HTML files for the Developer Manual.

   * Option 1: Run the :command:`make` command::
  
       make html
   
   * Option 2: Run the :command:`sphinx-build` command::

       sphinx-build -b html . build/html

     .. note:: You may need to create the :file:`build/html` directory.

#. Create a zip file containig two folders, user and developer, with the respective HTML docs built in the previous steps.
   Under a Unix like system you can achieve it by getting into `geoserver/src/target` and perform the following commands:

      ln -s ../../../doc/en/user/build/html user
      ln -s ../../../doc/en/developer/build/html developer
      zip -r geoserver-[VERSION]-htmldoc.zip user developer

   .. note:: When done, the zip file should contain two folders, one called :file:`user` containing the HTML output for the User Manual, and one called :file:`developer` containing the HTML output for the Developer Manual.

PDF
```

.. note:: Building PDF files from Sphinx is a two step process.  First, it is necessary to create LaTeX files from Sphinx.  Next, convert the LaTeX file to PDF using :command:`pdflatex`.

.. note:: Building PDF files, in addition to Sphinx, requires the :command:`pdflatex` utility.

#. Change to the root of the documentation directory.

#. Change directory to :file:`doc/user`.

#. Build LaTeX files for the User Manual.

   * Option 1: Run the :command:`make` command::
  
       make latex
   
   * Option 2: Run the :command:`sphinx-build` command::

       sphinx-build -b latex . build/latex

     .. note:: You may need to create the :file:`build/latex` directory.

#. Change directory to :file:`build/latex`.

#. Convert the .tex file to .pdf::

      pdflatex GeoServerUserManual.tex GeoServerUserManual.pdf

#. Immediately **run the same command a second time**::

      pdflatex GeoServerUserManual.tex GeoServerUserManual.pdf

   .. note:: This seemingly duplicate step is required because the PDF table of contents and associated bookmarks are not generated on the first pass.

#. Go back to the root of the documentation tree, and change directory to :file:`doc/developer`.

#. Build LaTeX files for the Developer Manual.

   * Option 1: Run the :command:`make` command::
  
       make latex
   
   * Option 2: Run the :command:`sphinx-build` command::

       sphinx-build -b latex . build/latex

     .. note:: You may need to create the :file:`build/latex` directory.

#. Change directory to :file:`build/latex`

#. Convert the .tex file to .pdf

      pdflatex GeoServerDeveloperManual.tex GeoServerDeveloperManual.pdf

#. Move the PDF created for the User Manual into this directory.

#. Create a zip containing the two PDF files::

      zip -r geoserver-[VERSION]-pdfdoc.zip *.pdf

CITE testing
------------

#. Change directory to :file:`src/target/release` and unzip the binary package::

     cd target/release
     unzip geoserver-*-bin.zip

#. Execute the GeoServer CITE tests as described in the :ref:`cite_test_guide`.

#. Unzip the war package and deploy the war in a servlet container such as
   Tomcat::

    unzip geoserver-*-war.zip
    cp geoserver.war /opt/tomcat5/webapps

#. Re-run GeoServer CITE tests with the war package.

Hand testing
------------

Start GeoServer with the release data directory and test by hand. A checklist of 
things to test can be found in the :ref:`release_testing_checklist`.

Deploy Artifacts
----------------

Deploy artifacts to the maven repository using the following command::

   mvn deploy

Build Windows installer
-----------------------

.. note:: This step requires a Windows machine.

#. Download and install `NSIS <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/>`_.

#. Install the `NSIS Access Control plugin <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/AccessControl_plug-in>`_.  The simplest way to do this is to download the zip, extract the two .DLL files (:file:`AccessControl.dll` and :file:`AccessControlW.dll`) and copy them to the NSIS plugins directory (usually :file:`C:\\Program Files\\NSIS\\Plugins`).

#. Unzip the binary GeoServer package::

        unzip geoserver-[VERSION]-bin.zip

#. Copy the files from :file:`src/release/installer/win` to the root of the unpacked archive (the same directory level as the :file:`start.jar`)::

      GeoServerEXE.nsi
      gs.ico
      header.bmp
      side_left.bmp
      splash.bmp
      wrapper.conf
      wrapper.dll
      wrapper.exe
      wrapper.jar
      wrapper-server-license.txt

   .. figure:: win-installer1.png
      :align: center

#. Right-click on the installer script :file:`GeoServerEXE.nsi` and select :command:`Compile Script`.  

   .. figure:: win-installer2.png
      :align: center

After successfully compiling the script, an installer named :file:`geoserver-[VERSION].exe` will be located in the root of the unpacked archive.

.. figure:: win-installer3.png
   :align: center


Build Mac OS X installer
------------------------

.. note::

   This step requires a Macintosh machine.

Change directory to :file:`src/release/installer/mac` and follow the instructions in 
:file:`README.txt`.

Release on JIRA
---------------

.. note::

   This step requires administrative privileges in JIRA.

#. `Log into GeoServer JIRA <http://jira.codehaus.org/login.jsp?os_destination=/browse/GEOS>`_.
#. Click the "Administer Project" link on the left hand side of the page.
  
   .. figure:: jira1.png

.. _upload_artifacts:

Upload release artifacts to SourceForge
---------------------------------------

All of the artifacts generated so far need to be uploaded to the SourceForce ``File release System``. There are various ways to do so, consult the `documentation <http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release files for download>`_ to find out the one better suited for you.

The simplest way for developers working under a Unix like system is to use :command:`scp`::
   
  scp *.zip username@frs.sourceforge.net:uploads
  
The same can be accomplished in Windows using `WinSCP <http://winscp.net>`_.

Release on SourceForge
----------------------

.. note::

   This step requires administrative privileges in SourceForge.
