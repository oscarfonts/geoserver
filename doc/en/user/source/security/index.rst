Security
========

This section details the security subsystem in GeoServer, which is based on `Spring Security <http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/>`_. For web-based configuration, please see the section on :ref:`webadmin_security` in the :ref:`web_admin`.

As of GeoServer 2.2.0, the security subsystem has been completely re-engineered, allowing for much more secure and flexible operations.
