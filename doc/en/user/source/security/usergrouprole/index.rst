Role system
===========

Security in GeoServer is a **role-based system** in which roles are created to serve particular functions. Examples of roles are accessing the WFS, administering the :ref:`web_admin`, and reading a specific layer. Roles are assigned to users and groups of users and determine what they are allowed to do and not do.  A user is asserted through :ref:`sec_auth`.
