Web Administration Interface
============================

The Web Administration Interface is a web-based tool for configuring all aspects of GeoServer, from adding data to tweaking service settings.  This is accessed via a web browser at http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web in a default GeoServer installation, although this URL may vary depending on how GeoServer is installed.
