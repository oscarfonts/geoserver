.. _webadmin_sec_settings:Settings========The Settings page controls the global settings related to GeoServer security... figure:: images/settings.png   :align: center   *Security Settings page*Active role service-------------------This menu item sets the active :ref:`role service <sec_rolesystem_roleservices>`, which is a source of information for roles.  The details of the role services are found and set on the :ref:`webadmin_sec_ugr` page.  There can be only one active role service at one time.Encryption----------The GeoServer UI can sometimes expose parameters in plain text inside the URLs.  Because of this, it can be desirable to encrypt the URL parameters.  This can be done in GeoServer via the check box for :guilabel:`Encrypt web admin URL parameters`, which uses a PBE-based :ref:`sec_passwd_encryption`.  For example, with this feature enabled, the page::  http://GEOSERVER/web/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:org.geoserver.security.web.SecuritySettingsPagewould now be found at the following URL::  http://GEOSERVER/web/?x=hrTNYMcF3OY7u4NdyYnRanL6a1PxMdLxTZcY5xK5ZXyi617EFEFCagMwHBWhrlg*ujTOyd17DLSn0NO2JKO1Dw.. warning:: JUSTIN-TODO: DETAILS ON THIS PBE?Password encryption-------------------This setting allows you to set the form of :ref:`sec_passwd_encryption` used on passwords.  Options are :guilabel:`Plain text`, :guilabel:`Weak PBE`, or :guilabel:`Strong PBE`.If Strong PBE is not available as part of the  JVM, a warning will display and the option will be disabled.  To enable Strong PBE, you will need to install external policy JARs allowing this form of encryption.  See the section on :ref:`sec_passwd_encryption` for more details about these settings... figure:: images/settings_pbewarning.png   :align: center   *Warning when Strong PBE is not available*.. warning:: THIS DIDN'T WORK FOR ME
